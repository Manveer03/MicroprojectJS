                        Basketball is a dynamic team sport played on a rectangular court where two teams, each consisting of five players, compete to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's hoop. This fast-paced game is governed by a set of rules designed to ensure fair play and to showcase the skills and strategies of the players.
